# List filters accepted by a resource

Lists the filters published in the OpenAPI contract supported by this
package. Unknown filters are rejected before a request is sent to
prevent silently incorrect queries. Filter names and categorical values
remain in Portuguese because they are part of the upstream API contract.

## Usage

``` r
list_filters(resource)

obrasgov_filtros(recurso)
```

## Arguments

- resource:

  A resource name returned by
  [`list_resources()`](https://strategicprojects.github.io/obrasgov/reference/list_resources.md).
  Portuguese resource names used by earlier package versions are also
  accepted.

- recurso:

  Portuguese alias for `resource`, available only in
  `obrasgov_filtros()`.

## Value

A tibble containing filter names, expected types, and allowed values
when applicable.

## Examples

``` r
list_filters("projects")
